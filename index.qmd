#### Course Description   

Python is a general purpose programming language that can be used for many purposes.  It has become especially important for machine learning and for data analysis more generally.  It can also be used as a substitute for MATLAB, Stata, SAS, and R.  This course provides an introduction to the python programming language and to the python
libraries that are most useful for business research.  The topics to be covered in the course are listed below.  This is a hands-on course, and a part of each class session will be allocated to students working individually or in groups to apply and extend the class material.  

ChatGPT makes it much easier to use python.  Throughout the course, we will generate python code by using ChatGPT-4 either at the OpenAI website (for this, I highly recommend a Plus subscription) or via an extension to VS Code.    

#### Grading

There will be weekly assignments.  There will not be an exam.

#### Course Schedule


1. Preliminaries: libraries, IDEs, environments, git
2. Basic python: strings, ints, floats, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, conditional statements, loops, functions, classes
3. Vectors and matrices: numpy
4. Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
5. Scientific programming: scipy, cvxopt
6. Data handling: pandas
7. Statistics: statsmodels, linearmodels
8. Machine learning for classification: scikit-learn, xgboost
9. Machine learning for regression: scikit-learn, xgboost
10. Neural networks: tensorflow, pytorch

Possible topics for days 11 and 12 include beautiful soup and selenium for web scraping, NLTK for natural language processing, OpenAI gym for reinforcement learning, LSTM models for time-series forecasting, plotly for interactive graphics and animations, and dash for web apps.  It is also possible that we use days 11 and 12 to go more deeply into topics covered previously.
