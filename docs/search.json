Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\nRoom 316, 2:15 – 3:45, 8/21/2023 – 10/2/2023\n\n\n\nPython is a general purpose programming language that can be used for many purposes. It has become especially important for machine learning and for data analysis more generally. It can also be used as a substitute for MATLAB, Stata, SAS, and R. This course provides an introduction to the python programming language and to the python libraries that are most useful for business research. The topics to be covered in the course are listed below. This is a hands-on course, and a part of each class session will be allocated to students working individually or in groups to apply and extend the class material.\nChatGPT makes it much easier to use python. Throughout the course, we will generate python code by using ChatGPT-4 either at the OpenAI website (for this, I highly recommend a Plus subscription) or via an extension to VS Code.\nIt is fine if you have zero experience with python or any other programming language. It is also fine if you are experienced with python and are taking the course only to learn about certain libraries you haven’t used before. In the former case, I will not expect you to become a proficient programmer in six weeks. My goal in that case is to introduce you to the possibilities and show you how to get started. Googling and ChatGPT can take care of the rest.\n\n\n\nThere will be weekly assignments. You are allowed to google and/or to use ChatGPT for assistance with the assignments. There will not be an exam.\n\n\n\nThis is a tentative schedule. I think it is a feasible schedule even for students with zero prior programming experience. However, it may be modified based on student interests and abilities.\n\nPreliminaries: libraries, IDEs, environments, git\nBasic python: data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, classes\nVectors and matrices: numpy\nVisualization: matplotlib, seaborn\nScientific programming: scipy, cvxopt\nData handling: pandas and SQL\nStatistics: statsmodels, linearmodels\nMachine learning for classification: scikit-learn, xgboost\nMachine learning for regression and data pipelines: scikit-learn, xgboost\nNeural networks: pytorch\nReinforcement learning: pytorch, openai gym\nWeb scraping: beautiful soup, selenium"
