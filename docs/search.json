However, it may be appropriate for students in other programs also.\nPython is a general purpose programming language that has become especially important for machine learning and for data analysis more generally. It can be used as a substitute for MATLAB, Stata, SAS, and R and also for web scraping, natural language processing, and much more. This course provides an introduction to the language and to the libraries that are most useful for business research. The topics to be covered in the course are listed below. This is a hands-on course, and a part of each class session will be allocated to students working individually or in groups to apply and extend the class material.\nChatGPT makes it much easier to use python. Throughout the course, we will generate python code by using ChatGPT-4 either at the OpenAI website (for this, I highly recommend a Plus subscription) or via an extension to VS Code.\nIt is fine if you have zero experience with python or any other programming language. It is also fine if you are experienced with python and are taking the course only to learn about certain libraries you haven’t used before. In the former case, I will not expect you to become a proficient programmer in six weeks. My goal in that case is to introduce you to the possibilities and show you how to get started. Googling and ChatGPT can take care of the rest.\n\n\n\nThere will be weekly assignments. You are allowed to google and/or to use ChatGPT for assistance with the assignments. There will not be an exam.\n\n\n\nThis is a tentative schedule. I think it is a feasible schedule even for students with zero prior programming experience. However, it may be modified based on student interests and experience.\n\nPreliminaries: libraries, IDEs, environments, git\nBasic python: data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, classes\nVectors and matrices: numpy\nData handling: pandas\nMore data handling: pandas and SQL\nVisualization: matplotlib, seaborn\nScientific programming: scipy, cvxopt\nStatistics: statsmodels, linearmodels\nMachine learning for classification: scikit-learn, xgboost\nMachine learning for regression and data pipelines: scikit-learn, xgboost\nNeural networks: pytorch\nWeb scraping: beautiful soup, selenium"

    "text": "Read the datasets announcements.csv and crsp.csv into dataframes. Each row of announcements.csv is a (stock, quarter) pair. Each row of crsp.csv is a (stock, day) pair. Complete the following. Upload a zip file containing (i) your code, (ii) a text file or Word doc containing your answers to 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15, and (iii) three .csv files as specified in 8, 11, and 14.\n\nHow many stock-days are there in the crsp dataframe? How many stock-quarters are there in announcements.csv?\nHow many unique permnos are there in the announcements dataframe? Hint: there is a “unique” method. Use “len” also.\nCreate a “quarter” column in the announcements dataframe based on the fiscal_period column.\nCreate a “quarter” column in the crsp dataframe based on the date column.\nExtract the last day of each quarter for each permno in the crsp dataframe. Hint: use groupby and .last().\nChange the name of the ‘date’ column in the announcements dataframe to ‘ea_date’. This is the date of the firm’s quarterly earnings announcement. Hint: pass a dictionary as columns = {‘old name’: ‘new name’} to the rename method.\nMerge the reduced crsp dataframe with the announcement dataframe, matching on [‘permno’, ‘quarter’]. Hint: permno and quarter will form the index of the reduced crsp dataframe after grouping. You will need to reset the index or use left_on=… and right_index=True, or right_on=… and left_index=True in the merge.\nFilter the merged dataframe to keep only rows satisfying price>=5, me>=50000, and shrcd in [10, 11]. Save this as a csv file with the name merged.csv and submit on Canvas. Use the filtered dataframe to answer all remaining questions.\nHow many stock-quarters are there in the filtered dataframe and how many unique permnos?\nWhich day of the week is the most popular day for earnings announcements? What fraction of earnings announcements occur on this day? Hint: the weekday method of a datetime object returns 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.\nFor each permno, find the most popular day of the week for earnings announcements. For each permno, calculate the fraction of the announcements that are made on that day. Save this as a csv file with the name days.csv and submit on Canvas. What is the mean of this fraction across permnos?\nCut the dataframe into ‘above median’ and ‘below median’ based on the absolute value of date_diff. What is the mean of the fraction in the previous queston across permnos within each of the two groups?\nFor each permno, calculate the fraction of zeros for date_diff.\nFilter the dataframe further to include only stock-quarters for which\n\nthe fraction of zeros for date_diff is less than 0.5\nthe fraction of announcements on the permno’s most popular day of the week is less than 0.9.\n\n\nSave this as a csv file with the name filtered.csv and submit on Canvas.\n\nHow many stock-quarters are in the newly filtered dataframe? How many unique permnos?"
