## Installing python

- Install from python.org or anaconda.com.  I use python.org but either will work.

    - anaconda installs scientific packages: numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, jupyter, ...
    - package manager: conda vs. pip
    - We can do the installations easily ourselves, so conda vs. pip is the main difference.
- Either way, add python to your path.

## Installing VS Code

- VS Code is an IDE (integrated development environment)
- VS Code is short for Visual Studio Code.  
  - Visual Studio is for .NET and C++ developers.  We don't need it.  
  - VS Code is a stand-alone and much smaller product.
- There are alternatives, but I like VS Code.

## VS Code Extensions

After installing VS Code, google in a browser to find the VS Code Marketplace (or click the Extensions icon on the left panel in VS Code) and install these extensions:

- Python
- ChatGpt4 (by bito)
- Latex Workshop (if you want)

## Command Palette in VS Code

- CTRL-SHFT-P opens the command palette.
- Find "Select Python Interpreter" and make sure that your installation of python has been detected.

## Open Folder

- File/Open Folder and browse to find a folder in which you want to work.
- Click Pages icon on left if necessary to see a File Explorer.

## Terminal

- Terminal/New Terminal to get a terminal (command prompt).

## File/New File

- Open a
