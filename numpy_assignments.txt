NumPy Course Assignments
========================

1. Creating Arrays:
   - Create a one-dimensional array of integers from 0 to 9.
   - Create a two-dimensional array of zeros with shape (5, 5).
   - Create a three-dimensional array of ones with shape (2, 3, 4).

2. Array Manipulation:
   - Reshape the above two-dimensional array to a one-dimensional array.
   - Stack two arrays horizontally and vertically.
   - Split a given array into multiple sub-arrays.

3. Array Indexing:
   - Extract the third and fifth elements from a one-dimensional array.
   - Extract a 2x2 sub-matrix from a given two-dimensional array.
   - Use boolean indexing to extract even numbers from an array.

   - Identify and handle missing data.

3. Simulation:
   - Simulate random walks using NumPy's random module.
   - Calculate probabilities or other statistical measures based on the simulation results.
